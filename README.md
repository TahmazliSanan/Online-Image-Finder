  <h1>Online Image Finder</h1>

  <p>
    I created Online Image Finder Web App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is my first Frontend project. Page consists a search input and 2 buttons (Search and clear).
    So, some pictures are shown to you after you write name of picture. I used some knowledge for this project. These are DOM, custom functions, asynchronous programming 
    and fetching of API. I fetch the data from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a> website.
